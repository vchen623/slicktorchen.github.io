<ul>
    <li>Writing this first post after a while to get the hang of this.</li>
    <li>While making the first post in over 4 years, I had to do some house cleaning.</li>
    <li>Github now requires tokens instead of username/password.</li>
    <li>I had to generate a new token to access the repository.</li>
    <li>ChatGPT was very helpful for getting things started.</li>
    <li>I learned how to use drafts.</li>
    <li>All you need to do is to create a 'drafts' directory.</li>
    <li>Then in the home directory, do 'bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts'</li>
    <li>When I did this I came across some additional issues.</li>
    <li>This involved the 'No Github API authentication' error.</li>
    <li>This was easily fixed by adding 'github: [metadata]' to the 'config.yml' file.</li>
    <li>I got an additional error for: 'jekyll 3.9.0 | Error: no implicit conversion of Hash into Integer'</li>
    <li>This was resolved by executing 'bundle add webrick' (which is apparently to install a dependency missing from Ruby 3.0 or later)</li>
    <li>Then 'bundle update github-pages' (to update all relevant gems)</li>
    <li>Finally 'bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts' to see the results in 'localhost:4000/mm/dd/yyyy/_nameofpost_ </li>
</ul>
